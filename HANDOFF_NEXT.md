# Handoff Prompt for Next Session

## Project Overview
This is a cross-platform mobile app (Android and iOS) for small clinics and solo practitioners to manage patients, generate service quotes, and create bills. The app is being developed using React Native with a modular approach.

## Current Status
Four modules have been completed and pushed to the GitHub repository:

1. **Patient Management Module**
   - Complete CRUD operations for patient profiles
   - Search and sort functionality
   - Patient details view with medical history

2. **Appointment Scheduling Module**
   - Calendar view with appointment indicators
   - Time slot management to prevent double-booking
   - Filtering by appointment status

3. **Service Management Module**
   - Service and category management
   - Price and duration tracking
   - Search, sort, and filter capabilities

4. **Quote Generator Module**
   - Quote creation with patient and service selection
   - Dynamic calculation of subtotal, discount, tax, and total
   - Quote status management (draft, final, converted)
   - PDF generation placeholder

## Next Steps
The next module to implement is the **Billing System Module**, which should include:

1. **Data Models**
   - Create Bill model with fields for patient, services, payment status, etc.
   - Design BillItem model to represent individual services in a bill
   - Create Payment model to track payment history

2. **UI Components**
   - Bill creation form (with option to convert from quote)
   - Bill details view with payment history
   - Payment recording interface
   - Bill list with search and filter

3. **Core Functionality**
   - Generate PDF invoices with clinic name/logo
   - Track payment status (unpaid, partially paid, paid)
   - Record multiple payments against a bill
   - Calculate outstanding balance

4. **Integration**
   - Connect with Patient, Service, and Quote modules
   - Prepare for integration with Data Export module

## Technical Details
- The app uses React Native for cross-platform compatibility
- State management is handled with Redux and Redux Persist
- Local storage is implemented with Realm Database
- Navigation uses React Navigation with a tab-based structure

## Repository
GitHub: https://github.com/cshlok/Hmsminiapp

## User Requirements
- Modern minimalistic UI with cool color scheme
- Simple to use interface
- Local device-based storage (offline functionality)
- Data export capability in XLS format
- PIN/biometric authentication

Please continue the modular development approach, completing one module at a time and notifying the user after each module is ready for review and collaboration.
