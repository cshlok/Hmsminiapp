# Clinic Management App - Architecture and Tech Stack

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and technology stack for a cross-platform mobile application designed for small clinics and solo practitioners. The app will enable users to manage patients, schedule appointments, handle services, generate quotes, and create bills, all with a modern minimalistic UI and offline-first approach.

## Requirements Summary

- Cross-platform support (Android and iOS)
- Modern minimalistic UI with cool color scheme
- Local device-based storage (offline functionality)
- PIN/biometric authentication (Face ID, fingerprint)
- Data export capability (XLS format)
- Patient management
- Appointment scheduling
- Dynamic service management
- Quote generation with PDF export
- Billing system

## Technology Stack

After careful consideration of the requirements, we've selected the following technology stack:

### Framework: React Native

React Native is chosen as the primary framework for the following reasons:

10. **Testing**:
    - Jest - For unit and integration testing
    - React Native Testing Library - For component testing

## Application Architecture

The application will follow a modular, layered architecture to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability:

### 1. Presentation Layer

- **Components**: Reusable UI components
- **Screens**: Full application screens composed of components
- **Navigation**: Screen routing and navigation logic

### 2. State Management Layer

- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

### 4. Data Layer

- **Models**: Data structure definitions
- **Repositories**: Data access abstraction
- **Storage**: Local database operations
- **API**: External service communication (if needed in future)

## Data Model

The application will use the following core data models:

### Patient
```
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  age: number,
  gender: string,
  contact: string,
  email: string,
  address: string,
  medicalHistory: string,
  allergies: string,
  medications: string,
  lastVisit: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Appointment
```
{
  id: string,
  patientId: string,
  date: Date,
  time: string,
  duration: number,
  status: string, // scheduled, completed, cancelled
  notes: string,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Service Category
```
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Service
```
{
  id: string,
  categoryId: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  price: number,
  duration: number,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Quote
```
{
  id: string,
  patientId: string,
  date: Date,
  services: [
    {
      serviceId: string,
      quantity: number,
      price: number
    }
  ],
  subtotal: number,
  discountPercent: number,
  discountAmount: number,
  taxPercent: number,
  taxAmount: number,
  total: number,
  notes: string,
  status: string, // draft, sent, converted
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Bill/Invoice
```
{
  id: string,
  quoteId: string, // if converted from quote
  patientId: string,
  date: Date,
  services: [
    {
      serviceId: string,
      quantity: number,
      price: number
    }
  ],
  subtotal: number,
  discountPercent: number,
  discountAmount: number,
  taxPercent: number,
  taxAmount: number,
  total: number,
  paymentStatus: string, // paid, partial, unpaid
  paymentMethod: string,
  notes: string,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**:
   - PIN code storage with secure hashing
   - Biometric authentication using device-native APIs
   - Automatic session timeout

2. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypted local database
   - Secure export process for patient data

## Offline Functionality

The app will be designed with an offline-first approach:
- All data stored locally on device
- No dependency on internet connectivity
- Complete functionality available offline
- Data export available without network connection

## UI/UX Design Principles

1. **Modern Minimalistic UI**:
   - Clean, uncluttered interfaces
   - Focused content with clear visual hierarchy
   - Whitespace utilization for improved readability

2. **Color Scheme**:
   - Primary: #4A6FE3 (Cool Blue)
   - Secondary: #2CCCE4 (Teal)
   - Accent: #8C42AB (Purple)
   - Background: #F8F9FA (Light Gray)
   - Text: #212529 (Dark Gray)
   - Success: #28A745 (Green)
   - Warning: #FFC107 (Amber)
   - Error: #DC3545 (Red)

3. **Accessibility**:
   - High contrast text
   - Adequate touch targets (minimum 44x44 points)
   - Support for dynamic text sizes
   - Screen reader compatibility

## Performance Considerations

1. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - Memoization of components and selectors
   - Lazy loading of screens and assets
   - Efficient list rendering with FlatList
   - Minimizing re-renders with React.memo and useMemo

2. **Database Performance**:
   - Indexed queries for faster data retrieval
   - Batch operations for multiple updates
   - Optimized schema design
