## Risk Management

### Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Cross-Platform Compatibility Issues**

   - **Mitigation**: Regular testing on both platforms throughout development, platform-specific code where necessary

2. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - **Risk**: App performance degradation with large numbers of patients or appointments
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination, optimize database queries, use virtualized lists

3. **Local Storage Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Exceeding device storage capacity with large amounts of data
   - **Mitigation**: Implement data archiving options, optimize storage usage, monitor database size

4. **PDF Generation Performance**
   - **Risk**: Slow PDF generation for complex documents
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize templates, generate PDFs asynchronously, show progress indicators

5. **Authentication Security**
   - **Risk**: Vulnerabilities in PIN storage or biometric implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Follow platform security best practices, use secure storage for sensitive data
