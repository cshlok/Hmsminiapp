# TypeScript Error Tracking

This document tracks the TypeScript errors in the Hmsminiapp project, both fixed and remaining.

## Fixed Errors

### Settings Screens
- ✅ Converted AuthLogsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted ExportJobsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Removed unused imports in AuthLogsScreen.tsx (LoginIcon, LogoutIcon, AccountIcon, React)
- ✅ Fixed type errors in SettingsContainer.tsx
- ✅ Converted AboutScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Removed unused React import in AboutScreen.tsx
- ✅ Fixed settings property access error in settingsSlice.ts

### Testing Screens
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in TestingDashboard.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in OptimizationDashboard.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in FinalReportScreen.tsx

### Service Screens
- ✅ Converted ServiceListScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted ServiceCard component from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Fixed type mismatches in ServiceListContainer.tsx (ICategory[] vs IServiceCategory[])
- ✅ Removed React Native imports from ServiceListContainer.tsx
- ✅ Fixed Redux store type alignment in serviceSlice.ts by adding missing properties and reducers
- ✅ Removed unused props from ServiceListScreen.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused IServiceCategory import from serviceSlice.ts
- ✅ Converted ServiceDetailsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted ServiceDetailsContainer.tsx from React Native to Material-UI and added type annotations
- ✅ Converted AddEditServiceScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI and added type annotations
- ✅ Converted ServiceForm component from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted AddEditCategoryScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI and added type annotations
- ✅ Converted CategoryForm component from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Investigated ServiceDetailScreen.tsx and ServiceFormScreen.tsx: Found existing web components (`/pages/services/ServiceDetails.tsx`, `/pages/services/ServiceForm.tsx`) using React/Tailwind; no React Native conversion needed.

### Quote Screens
- ✅ Converted QuoteListScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted QuoteCard component from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Fixed missing properties in IPatient interface (firstName, lastName)

### Components & Pages (Implicit 'any' Fixes)
- ✅ Replaced implicit `any` with explicit `Partial<IServiceCategory>` in `/src/components/service/CategoryForm.tsx`
- ✅ Replaced implicit `any` with explicit `Partial<IService>` in `/src/components/service/ServiceForm.tsx`
- ✅ Converted `/src/components/appointment/AppointmentForm.tsx` from React Native to Material-UI and replaced implicit `any` with explicit `Partial<IAppointment>`
- ✅ Converted `/src/components/patient/PatientForm.tsx` from React Native to Material-UI and replaced implicit `any` with explicit `Partial<IPatient>`
- ✅ Replaced implicit `any` in `setErrors` call within `/src/pages/appointments/AppointmentForm.tsx`

## Remaining Errors

### General Type Issues
- ❌ Fix remaining type mismatches between interfaces and props (e.g., `IPatient` definitions in models vs. slices, `IQuote` missing `validUntil`)
- ❌ Resolve module import/export errors (e.g., `SettingsModel` members in `storage.ts`)
- ❌ Address type incompatibility issues (e.g., `Date` vs `string` for `startTime` in `storage.ts`)
- ❌ Fix unused variable errors (e.g., `IQuoteItem` in `quoteSlice.ts`)

## Build Status
- Current error count: 485 (as of last build attempt)
- Major error categories:
  - Type mismatches between interface definitions (models vs. slices)
  - Missing properties in interfaces
  - Module import/export errors
  - Type incompatibilities (e.g., Date vs string)

## Next Steps
1. Fix type mismatches between interfaces (e.g., `IPatient` in `patientSlice.ts`).
2. Resolve module import/export errors in `storage.ts`.
3. Address type incompatibilities in `storage.ts`.
4. Remove unused variables like `IQuoteItem`.
5. Reattempt production build and reassess errors.
6. Commit and push all accumulated changes before credits expire.
7. Deploy permanently once all errors are resolved.

## Notes
This is a work in progress. The goal is to systematically fix all TypeScript errors to enable a successful production build and permanent deployment. Commits are currently deferred until closer to the credit limit, per user instruction.

## Progress Summary
We've made significant progress by:
1. Converting all major screens from React Native to Material-UI
2. Removing unused imports across multiple files
3. Adding necessary dependencies
4. Fixing type mismatches in Redux store and settings slice
5. Converting service components to use Material-UI
6. Fixing type mismatches in ServiceListContainer.tsx
7. Removing all React Native imports and references
8. Aligning Redux store types with component expectations
9. Converting ServiceDetailsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
10. Converting ServiceDetailsContainer.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
11. Converting AddEditServiceScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
12. Converting ServiceForm component from React Native to Material-UI
13. Converting AddEditCategoryScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
14. Converting CategoryForm component from React Native to Material-UI
15. Converting QuoteListScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
16. Converting QuoteCard component from React Native to Material-UI
17. Fixing missing properties in IPatient interface
18. Confirmed existing service detail/form pages are web components
19. Fixed implicit `any` types in `CategoryForm.tsx`, `ServiceForm.tsx`, `AppointmentForm.tsx` (component), `PatientForm.tsx` (component), and `AppointmentForm.tsx` (page).
20. Converted `AppointmentForm.tsx` (component) and `PatientForm.tsx` (component) from React Native to Material-UI.

The remaining work focuses on addressing type mismatches, import/export errors, and type incompatibilities throughout the codebase.
