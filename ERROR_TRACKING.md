# TypeScript Error Tracking

This document tracks the TypeScript errors in the Hmsminiapp project, both fixed and remaining.

## Fixed Errors

### Settings Screens
- ✅ Converted AuthLogsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted ExportJobsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Removed unused imports in AuthLogsScreen.tsx (LoginIcon, LogoutIcon, AccountIcon, React)
- ✅ Fixed type errors in SettingsContainer.tsx
- ✅ Converted AboutScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Removed unused React import in AboutScreen.tsx
- ✅ Fixed settings property access error in settingsSlice.ts

### Testing Screens
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in TestingDashboard.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in OptimizationDashboard.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in FinalReportScreen.tsx

### Service Screens
- ✅ Converted ServiceListScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted ServiceCard component from React Native to Material-UI

### Dependencies
- ✅ Added @mui/icons-material dependency

## Remaining Errors

### Service Screens
- ❌ Fix type mismatches in ServiceListContainer.tsx (ICategory[] vs IServiceCategory[])
- ❌ Convert ServiceDetailScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ❌ Convert ServiceFormScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI

### Testing Screens
- ❌ Fix remaining unused imports in testing screens

### General Type Issues
- ❌ Fix implicit 'any' type parameters throughout the codebase
- ❌ Fix type mismatches between interfaces and props
- ❌ Add explicit type annotations where needed

## Build Status
- Current error count: 534 (as of last build attempt)
- Major error categories:
  - React Native dependencies that need to be replaced with Material-UI
  - Unused imports
  - Type mismatches between interfaces and props
  - Implicit 'any' types

## Next Steps
1. Continue converting React Native components to Material-UI
2. Fix type mismatches in service-related files
3. Clean up remaining unused imports
4. Add explicit type annotations where needed
5. Reattempt production build and reassess errors
6. Deploy permanently once all errors are resolved

## Notes
This is a work in progress. The goal is to systematically fix all TypeScript errors to enable a successful production build and permanent deployment.

## Progress Summary
We've made significant progress by:
1. Converting major screens from React Native to Material-UI
2. Removing unused imports across multiple files
3. Adding necessary dependencies
4. Fixing type mismatches in Redux store and settings slice
5. Converting service components to use Material-UI

The remaining work focuses on service-related screens and general type issues throughout the codebase.
