# TypeScript Error Tracking

This document tracks the TypeScript errors in the Hmsminiapp project, both fixed and remaining. The remaining work is divided between Agent 1 and Agent 2.

## Fixed Errors

### Settings Screens
- ✅ Converted AuthLogsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted ExportJobsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Removed unused imports in AuthLogsScreen.tsx (LoginIcon, LogoutIcon, AccountIcon, React)
- ✅ Fixed type errors in SettingsContainer.tsx
- ✅ Converted AboutScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Removed unused React import in AboutScreen.tsx
- ✅ Fixed settings property access error in settingsSlice.ts

### Testing Screens
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in TestingDashboard.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in OptimizationDashboard.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in FinalReportScreen.tsx

### Service Screens
- ✅ Converted ServiceListScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted ServiceCard component from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Fixed type mismatches in ServiceListContainer.tsx (ICategory[] vs IServiceCategory[])

### General Type Issues
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in AppointmentCalendar.tsx (MarkedDate interface)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AppointmentForm.tsx (setFieldValue parameters)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in BillForm.tsx (calculateTotals items parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in PatientForm.tsx (onSubmit and handleGenderSelect parameters)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in QuoteForm.tsx (calculateTotals items parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in CategoryForm.tsx (onSubmit parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in ServiceForm.tsx (onSubmit parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in AppointmentCalendarContainer.tsx (handleEventClick parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in SettingsLayout.tsx (tab.id cast)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AddEditAppointmentScreen.tsx (navigation, route, patients props and handleSubmit parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AddEditBillScreen.tsx (navigation and route props)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AddEditPatientScreen.tsx (navigation, route props and handleSubmit parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in PatientListScreen.tsx (navigation prop)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AddEditQuoteScreen.tsx (navigation and route props)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AddEditCategoryScreen.tsx (navigation, route props and handleSubmit parameter)

## Remaining Errors & Task Division

### Agent 1 Tasks:
- ❌ **Fix Implicit 'any' Types (Components & Pages):** Systematically find and replace remaining implicit 'any' types in component props and function parameters within the `/src/components` and `/src/pages` directories.
  - Example files (check for remaining 'any'):
    - `/src/components/appointment/AppointmentForm.tsx`
    - `/src/components/patient/PatientForm.tsx`
    - `/src/pages/appointments/AppointmentForm.tsx`

### Agent 2 Tasks:
- ❌ **Fix Type Mismatches & Add Annotations (Store, Utils, Screens):** Focus on fixing type mismatches between interfaces and props, and adding explicit type annotations (return types, complex state types, etc.) where needed, primarily within the `/src/store`, `/src/utils`, and `/src/screens` directories (excluding already fixed files).
- ❌ **Investigate Missing Service Screens:** Attempt to locate or determine the status of `ServiceDetailScreen.tsx` and `ServiceFormScreen.tsx`. If found, convert them from React Native to Material-UI.

## Build Status
- Current error count: Significantly reduced (exact count to be determined on next build attempt).
- Major remaining error categories:
  - Remaining implicit 'any' types
  - Type mismatches between interfaces and props
  - Missing explicit type annotations
  - Potentially missing files or React Native dependencies if `ServiceDetailScreen.tsx` / `ServiceFormScreen.tsx` are found.

## Next Steps (Overall)
1. Agent 1 and Agent 2 work on their assigned tasks concurrently or sequentially.
2. Commit changes after each logical fix.
3. Update this tracking document as tasks are completed.
4. Reattempt production build (`npm run build`) periodically to assess error reduction.
5. Once all errors are resolved, perform final validation and prepare for deployment.

## Notes
This division aims to parallelize the remaining type-checking work. Communication between agents will be crucial if dependencies or shared interfaces are involved.

## Progress Summary
Significant progress has been made in converting components, removing unused imports, and fixing numerous implicit 'any' type errors across various parts of the application. The remaining work involves a final sweep for type safety and addressing the potentially missing service screens.
