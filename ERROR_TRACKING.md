# TypeScript Error Tracking

This document tracks the TypeScript errors in the Hmsminiapp project, both fixed and remaining.

## Fixed Errors

### Settings Screens
- ✅ Converted AuthLogsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted ExportJobsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Removed unused imports in AuthLogsScreen.tsx (LoginIcon, LogoutIcon, AccountIcon, React)
- ✅ Fixed type errors in SettingsContainer.tsx
- ✅ Converted AboutScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Removed unused React import in AboutScreen.tsx
- ✅ Fixed settings property access error in settingsSlice.ts

### Testing Screens
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in TestingDashboard.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in OptimizationDashboard.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused React imports in FinalReportScreen.tsx

### Service Screens
- ✅ Converted ServiceListScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Converted ServiceCard component from React Native to Material-UI
- ✅ Fixed type mismatches in ServiceListContainer.tsx (ICategory[] vs IServiceCategory[])
- ✅ Removed React Native imports from ServiceListContainer.tsx
- ✅ Fixed Redux store type alignment in serviceSlice.ts by adding missing properties and reducers
- ✅ Removed unused props from ServiceListScreen.tsx
- ✅ Removed unused IServiceCategory import from serviceSlice.ts
- ✅ Converted ServiceDetailsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI

## Remaining Errors

### Service Screens
- ❌ Convert ServiceDetailsContainer.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
- ❌ Convert AddEditServiceScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI

### General Type Issues
- ❌ Fix implicit 'any' type parameters throughout the codebase
- ❌ Fix remaining type mismatches between interfaces and props
- ❌ Add explicit type annotations where needed

## Build Status
- Current error count: ~500 (as of last build attempt)
- Major error categories:
  - Type mismatches between interfaces and props
  - Implicit 'any' types
  - Remaining React Native dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Continue fixing type mismatches between interfaces and props
2. Add explicit type annotations where needed
3. Reattempt production build and reassess errors
4. Deploy permanently once all errors are resolved

## Notes
This is a work in progress. The goal is to systematically fix all TypeScript errors to enable a successful production build and permanent deployment.

## Progress Summary
We've made significant progress by:
1. Converting major screens from React Native to Material-UI
2. Removing unused imports across multiple files
3. Adding necessary dependencies
4. Fixing type mismatches in Redux store and settings slice
5. Converting service components to use Material-UI
6. Fixing type mismatches in ServiceListContainer.tsx
7. Removing all React Native imports and references
8. Aligning Redux store types with component expectations
9. Converting ServiceDetailsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI

The remaining work focuses on converting the last few React Native components to Material-UI and addressing general type issues throughout the codebase.
