## Remaining Errors

### General Type Issues
- ❌ Fix remaining type mismatches between interfaces and props (e.g., `IPatient` definitions in models vs. slices, `IQuote` missing `validUntil` in `storage.ts`)
- ❌ Resolve module import/export errors (e.g., `SettingsModel` members in `storage.ts`)
- ❌ Address type incompatibility issues (e.g., `Date` vs `string` for `startTime` in `storage.ts`)
- ❌ Fix unused variable errors (e.g., `IQuoteItem` in `quoteSlice.ts`)

## Build Status
- Current error count: 485 (as of last build attempt)
- Major error categories:
  - Type mismatches between interface definitions (models vs. slices)
  - Missing properties in interfaces/types
  - Module import/export errors
  - Type incompatibilities (e.g., Date vs string)

## Next Steps
1. Resolve merge conflicts (In Progress).
2. Fix type mismatches between interfaces (e.g., `IPatient` in `patientSlice.ts`).
3. Resolve module import/export errors in `storage.ts`.
4. Address type incompatibilities in `storage.ts`.
5. Remove unused variables like `IQuoteItem`.
6. Reattempt production build (`npm run build`) and reassess errors.
7. Commit and push all accumulated changes before credits expire.
8. Deploy permanently once all errors are resolved.

## Notes
This is a work in progress. The goal is to systematically fix all TypeScript errors to enable a successful production build and permanent deployment. Merge conflicts occurred during synchronization and are being resolved. Commits will be pushed once conflicts are resolved.

## Progress Summary
Significant progress has been made by:
1. Converting all major screens from React Native to Material-UI
2. Removing unused imports across multiple files
3. Adding necessary dependencies
4. Fixing type mismatches in Redux store and settings slice
5. Converting service components to use Material-UI
6. Fixing type mismatches in ServiceListContainer.tsx
7. Removing all React Native imports and references
8. Aligning Redux store types with component expectations
9. Converting ServiceDetailsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
10. Converting ServiceDetailsContainer.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
11. Converting AddEditServiceScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
12. Converting ServiceForm component from React Native to Material-UI
13. Converting AddEditCategoryScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
14. Converting CategoryForm component from React Native to Material-UI
15. Converting QuoteListScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
16. Converting QuoteCard component from React Native to Material-UI
17. Fixing missing properties in IPatient interface
18. Confirmed existing service detail/form pages are web components
19. Fixing numerous implicit 'any' type errors across various parts of the application.
20. Fixed implicit `any` types in `CategoryForm.tsx`, `ServiceForm.tsx`, `AppointmentForm.tsx` (component), `PatientForm.tsx` (component), and `AppointmentForm.tsx` (page).
21. Converted `AppointmentForm.tsx` (component) and `PatientForm.tsx` (component) from React Native to Material-UI.

The remaining work focuses on addressing type mismatches, import/export errors, and type incompatibilities throughout the codebase.
