- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in ServiceForm.tsx (onSubmit parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in AppointmentCalendarContainer.tsx (handleEventClick parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in SettingsLayout.tsx (tab.id cast)

- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AddEditBillScreen.tsx (navigation and route props)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AddEditPatientScreen.tsx (navigation, route props and handleSubmit parameter)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' type in PatientListScreen.tsx (navigation prop)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AddEditQuoteScreen.tsx (navigation and route props)
- ✅ Fixed implicit 'any' types in AddEditCategoryScreen.tsx (navigation, route props and handleSubmit parameter)

## Remaining Errors & Task Division

### Agent 1 Tasks:
- ❌ **Fix Implicit 'any' Types (Components & Pages):** Systematically find and replace remaining implicit 'any' types in component props and function parameters within the `/src/components` and `/src/pages` directories.
  - Example files (check for remaining 'any'):
    - `/src/components/appointment/AppointmentForm.tsx`
    - `/src/components/patient/PatientForm.tsx`
    - `/src/pages/appointments/AppointmentForm.tsx`

### Agent 2 Tasks:
- ❌ **Fix Type Mismatches & Add Annotations (Store, Utils, Screens):** Focus on fixing type mismatches between interfaces and props, and adding explicit type annotations (return types, complex state types, etc.) where needed, primarily within the `/src/store`, `/src/utils`, and `/src/screens` directories (excluding already fixed files).
- ❌ **Investigate Missing Service Screens:** Attempt to locate or determine the status of `ServiceDetailScreen.tsx` and `ServiceFormScreen.tsx`. If found, convert them from React Native to Material-UI.

## Build Status
- Current error count: Significantly reduced (exact count to be determined on next build attempt).
- Major remaining error categories:
  - Remaining implicit 'any' types
  - Type mismatches between interfaces and props
  - Missing explicit type annotations
  - Potentially missing files or React Native dependencies if `ServiceDetailScreen.tsx` / `ServiceFormScreen.tsx` are found.

## Next Steps (Overall)
1. Agent 1 and Agent 2 work on their assigned tasks concurrently or sequentially.
2. Commit changes after each logical fix.
3. Update this tracking document as tasks are completed.
4. Reattempt production build (`npm run build`) periodically to assess error reduction.
5. Once all errors are resolved, perform final validation and prepare for deployment.

## Notes
This division aims to parallelize the remaining type-checking work. Communication between agents will be crucial if dependencies or shared interfaces are involved.

## Progress Summary
Significant progress has been made by:
1. Converting all major screens from React Native to Material-UI
2. Removing unused imports across multiple files
3. Adding necessary dependencies
4. Fixing type mismatches in Redux store and settings slice
5. Converting service components to use Material-UI
6. Fixing type mismatches in ServiceListContainer.tsx
7. Removing all React Native imports and references
8. Aligning Redux store types with component expectations
9. Converting ServiceDetailsScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
10. Converting ServiceDetailsContainer.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
11. Converting AddEditServiceScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
12. Converting ServiceForm component from React Native to Material-UI
13. Converting AddEditCategoryScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
14. Converting CategoryForm component from React Native to Material-UI
15. Converting QuoteListScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI
16. Converting QuoteCard component from React Native to Material-UI
17. Fixing missing properties in IPatient interface
18. Fixing numerous implicit 'any' type errors across various parts of the application.

The remaining work involves a final sweep for type safety by Agent 1 and Agent 2, focusing on their assigned areas.
