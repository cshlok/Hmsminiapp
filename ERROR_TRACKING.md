## Remaining Errors

### Service Screens
- ❌ Convert ServiceDetailScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI (File not found in repository)
- ❌ Convert ServiceFormScreen.tsx from React Native to Material-UI (File not found in repository)

### General Type Issues
- ❌ Fix remaining implicit 'any' type parameters throughout the codebase
- ❌ Fix type mismatches between interfaces and props
- ❌ Add explicit type annotations where needed

## Build Status
- Current error count: Reduced from previous 534 (exact count to be determined on next build attempt)
- Major error categories:
  - React Native dependencies that need to be replaced with Material-UI
  - Remaining type mismatches between interfaces and props
  - Remaining implicit 'any' types

## Next Steps
1. Continue converting React Native components to Material-UI
2. Add explicit type annotations where needed
3. Fix remaining type mismatches between interfaces and props
4. Reattempt production build and reassess errors
5. Deploy permanently once all errors are resolved

## Notes
This is a work in progress. The goal is to systematically fix all TypeScript errors to enable a successful production build and permanent deployment.

## Progress Summary
We've made significant progress by:
1. Converting major screens from React Native to Material-UI
2. Removing unused imports across multiple files
3. Adding necessary dependencies
4. Fixing type mismatches in Redux store and settings slice
5. Converting service components to use Material-UI
6. Fixing type mismatches in ServiceListContainer.tsx
7. Removing all unused React imports in testing screens
8. Fixing multiple implicit 'any' types across various components:
   - Added explicit types for function parameters in AppointmentForm.tsx
   - Added MarkedDate interface in AppointmentCalendar.tsx
   - Added explicit Array types in BillForm.tsx and QuoteForm.tsx
   - Fixed onSubmit parameter types in multiple form components

The remaining work focuses on addressing the remaining general type issues throughout the codebase. Note that some files mentioned in the original error list (ServiceDetailScreen.tsx and ServiceFormScreen.tsx) were not found in the repository and could not be fixed.
